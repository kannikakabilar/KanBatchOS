# KanBatchOS
The Kan Batch OS Model is a Batch Operating System Simulator. Currently, this model supports running batches of Python, C, and, Java program files. Furthermore, this model can be easily modified to support the execution of other program files. This simulator is designed to run in a Linux hosted environment as it uses 'ls' command to collect the list of programming files to execute.
